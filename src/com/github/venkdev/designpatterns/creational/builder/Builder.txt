Conditions

2 Classes.
    Outer class which has to be built.
        No setters for the attributes
        One Constructor which accepts the inner class object as arg
    Inner static class(helper class)
        Contains all the attributes present in outer class
        Contains a private constructor and a newInstance method
        Contains setMethods for each of the attributes separately which would set the object and return the same instance(this)
        Contains Build method which returns the outer class object(this);

Overcomes the short comings of method chaining which fails in certain cases during concurrent access.
Method chaining -> Setter methods returning "this" instance. Which can be accessed like below.
student.setId(1).setName("aaa").setAddress("xyz");
